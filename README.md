# HealthVault Connection Center Prototype using Ghost features 

I built this back in 2010 to provide a prototype that could be used to test use cases and be used in usability studies. As a side project, I also took the Ghost concept and applied it to a WPF application by wrapping the UI around Ghost functionality. 


_Note: Rooler was not built by me. This was shared by another worker at Microsoft_
